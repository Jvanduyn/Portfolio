# Jacob VanDuyn's Portfolio

## Description

I created this website to host a place for potential employers and recruiters to be able to view my work on a website that I built. 

- My motivation was to build a functional website that would show future recruiters and employers my work and skills. 
- I wanted to build this project so that I could practice my HTML/CSS skills and show off my creative skills. 
- This website shows off my work that I will be completing during my time at UNCC coding bootcamp
- I was able to learn a few different tricks to be able to implement flex box.
